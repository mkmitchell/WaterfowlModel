# WaterfowlModel
Waterfowl Model Access Database and application

This database and application was created in an effort to create a simplified and documented process.
This is in the beta stage and isn't complete unless the spatial model is used to create the input.

The database will be shared via the releases and the ArcGIS Model will be tracked using commits.
