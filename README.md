# WaterfowlModel
Waterfowl Model Access Database and application<br>
<br>
This database and application was created in an effort to create a simplified and documented process.<br>
This is in the beta stage and isn't complete unless the spatial model is used to create the input.<br>
<br>
The database will be shared via the releases and the ArcGIS Model will be tracked using commits.<br>
